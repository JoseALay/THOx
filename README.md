# THOx
 v1.0
** THOx **  is a CDCC code for two-body projectiles, with the possibility of including core excitations. The code has been developed by the Nuclear Theory Group based at the University of Seville.

The code assumes a reaction of the form

  a(=c+v) + A -> c + v + A
  
where "c" and "v" are the fragment constituents (denoted, for convenience, core and valence particles, respectively). 

## Short input description 
###  SYSTEM  namelist: Zv, Av,  Zc, Ac, sn
- Zv, Zc: charge of valence and core particles
- Av, Ac: mass number of valence and core particles
- sn    : intrinsic spin of valence particle
