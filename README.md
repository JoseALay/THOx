# THOx

MGR: Introduced changes to transition_tdef, rmatel and solvecc to make target deformation form factors compatible with fresco

AMM: bins implemented, relativistic kinematics first attempted, reformatted for J Casal, better for AMM to document

Issues: Apart from those indicated in Issues tag, OpenMP is not working properly, needs to be checked

Corrected bug on transition_tdef
